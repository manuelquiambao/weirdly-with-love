    <h1>“We get inspiration from the stories people tell.</h1>
    <h1>What about stories we barely get to listen to at all?”</h1>
    <p>"weirdly, with love" is an Interactive Media website project by Manuel Quiambao focusing on the culture,
        folklore, and current happenings of marginalized communities and minorities across Canada. The website aims to depict these
        stories in an empathic, decolonial, and collaborative light. As such, its content will be focused on discourses between people
        within these cultures.</p>
    <p>"weirdly, with love" was initially seen as a method to explore and highlight folklore from marginalized cultures
        due to fantasy tropes being built on mostly Western perspectives and approaches on fantasy. As development grew,
        "weirdly, with love" transformed into a more generalized website aiming to share the lives of people from these
        cultures with a more empathic mindset -- aiming to "give the mic" to others. Even so, the idea of highlighting
        folklore for inspiring creative pursuits still persists in the vision for the website.</p>
